# 1.5.0

- Added `finished` event

# 1.3.3

Undefined values were being returned from the promise handling bug that was fixed last update. Now the module is 100% working as it should but there is 1 piece of code I would like to change back if I can find why it thought catches were not being handled despite firing code.

# 1.0.0

Initial release of the project
